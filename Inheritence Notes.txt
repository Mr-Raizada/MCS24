Inheritence Notes
//from generalization to specialization 
//Example of Employee class 
class BankAccount
{
	data members ;
	member functions;
}
// so to inheret this class we can use extend keyword. like saving account 
class SavingAccount extends BankAccount
{
	data members;
	member functions;
}
//a class derived from the super class is called a subclass.
//Sometimes superclass are also called as the parent class or base class 
//subclass- as child class or the derived class 


//An Employe class that is used to calculate the hourly pay of an worker to determine the work of it
